### Author: Emilly Njue

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for customer churn prediction in the telecommunications industry. The goal is to accurately identify customers who are likely to churn, enabling retention strategies and reducing the financial impact of customer churn.

## Business and Data Understanding

### Stakeholder Audience

The stakeholder audience for this project includes decision-makers and analysts at SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. They are interested in understanding customer churn patterns and predicting which customers are most likely to churn in order to take measures to retain them.

### Dataset Choice

The dataset used for this project contains historical customer data, including various features such as customer personal details such us phone numbers and account length, call usage, and service plan details. 

It also includes a binary target variable indicating whether a customer has churned or not.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the log loss and ROC-AUC score are calculated to assess the model's predictive accuracy and discriminatory power.

## Conclusion

Based on the evaluation results, the chosen model is selected as the final predictive model for customer churn prediction. The model demonstrates strong performance in accurately classifying customers as churned or non-churned, providing valuable insights.

The model's predictions and feature importance analysis offer actionable insights to understand the factors contributing to churn. 


Overall, this project provides a comprehensive solution for customer churn prediction, enabling SyriaTel to actively address churn and enhance customer retention efforts.
